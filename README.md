by aadityarengarajan

Hi! I have created this repository with a complete suite of Hospital Software within 36 hours of SOSC's HackNight for the Hackathon.

## Hosted Links

- https://labs.medicaware.intellx.co.in/login
- https://api.medicaware.intellx.co.in/read?key=$OSC&file=staff

## Skillsets Used
- Created this project using Python-Flask and HTML/CSS/JS
- Hosted it on my own Ubuntu server using Gunicorn and NGINX

## Features of this Suite
- Home/Webpage
- Patient//Client Portal to Book an Appointment Online, a unique feature of Self-Diagnosis, and see their profile.
- Android Web Application to see COVID Database, see Hospital Staff,unique Self Diagnosis, and a WebMD frame.
- A Front Desk//Reception Client to book an appointment, register a patient, and book a lab appointment.
- A Technical Staff Client to Manage Notices and Circulars.
- A Doctor-End Client to see list of appointments and complete their appointments on a daily basis.
- A Website for Lab Technicians where one can Register a Machine, See List of Lab Appointments, Upload and Send Lab Report(s).

## To-Do
More features are in exploration and consideration, but haven't been added due to the 36-hour limitation of the SOSC Hackathon. Might be implemented in future :
- Update Staff and Vacancies for Technical Staff
- Edit Profile for Patients
- Circulars as Newsletter for PR Imrpovement (e-mailing system already implemented, just need to add "subscribe" button and form at patient portal)
- Pharmacy Management at ('pharmacy.medicaware.intellx.co.in') where one can manage Medicines and use an online POS System (Point of Sales System)
- AI Assisted First-Aid for Patient Portal
- Photo Storage and Retrieval In-Database (add a route to API)
